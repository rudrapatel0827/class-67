  ** story **
Once upon a time there was an old man, an old woman, and a little boy.
One morning the old woman made some gingerbread in the shape of a man.
She added icing for his hair and clothes, and little blobs of dough for his nose and eyes. 
When she put him in the oven to bake, she said to the little boy, 
You watch the gingerbread man while your grandfather and I go out to work in the garden.
So the old man and the old woman went out and began to dig potatoes,
and left the little boy to tend the oven. But he started to day dream, and did not watch it all of the time. 
All of a sudden he heard a noise, and he looked up and the oven door popped open, 
and out of the oven jumped a gingerbread man, 
and went rolling along end over end towards the open door of the house. 
The little boy ran to shut the door, 
but the gingerbread man was too quick for him and rolled through the door, 
down the steps, 
and out into the road long before the little boy could catch him.
